## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![](https://github.com/mquimi/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/tree/main/imgs)
-Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
<br>The two variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values were the vehicle length and the groun_clearance. 
<br>
-Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
<br>From the screenshot above, both variables have a small p-value, which means that we have sufficient evidence to say that there was a siginificant impact on the mpg value. The linear regression shows that some variables had an effect on the dependant variable making the slop not zero.
<br>
-Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
<br>The r-squared value of the multiple linear regression model is the main reason of why the linear regression model predicts the mpg of the MechaCar: 0.71. In conclusion, this model would be considered effective.
